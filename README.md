# React Utilities for Extism

This repository contains hooks as well as a React component to make it easy for React developers to integrate [Extism](https://extism.org/) into their application. The implementation of these utilities is based off of the [Universal JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/extism/js-sdk). In some cases, you may be better off using that.

# Examples

An example application was created using `npx create-react-app example` and can be found in the root of this repository. The `App.js` component contains an example usage of the `usePlugin` hook, and the `ExtismPlugin` component. Check out the comments in the code for how to use the `useFunction` hook, and rendering `ExtismPlugin` with children.  You may start the application by running `npm start` in the example directory (after running `npm i`)
